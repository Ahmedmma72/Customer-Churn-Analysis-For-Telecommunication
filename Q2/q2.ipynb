For example, the company could offer better pricing plans or improve customer service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the company could implement a customer loyalty program to incentivize customers with Month-to-Month contracts to stay with the company. This program could offer rewards for staying with the company for a certain period of time or for referring new customers.\n",
