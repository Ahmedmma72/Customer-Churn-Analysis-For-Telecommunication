    "By analyzing the distribution of customers across different payment methods types, we can identify trends and patterns that can help the company make informed decisions about its business strategies. For example, if a particular payment method type has a low number of customers, the company may want to consider offering promotions or incentives to attract more customers to that service. On the other hand, if a particular service type has a high number of customers, the company may want to focus its resources on maintaining the quality of that service to retain those customers."

    "\n",
    "When we analyzed the churn value for each service type, we found that Mailed Check and Bank Withdrawal Payment methods have the highest churn rates at 38% and 35%, respectively. On the other hand, customers who pay using credit cards have the lowest churn rate at nearly 14%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our findings suggest that the company should focus on improving the quality of its Mailed Check and Bank Withdrawal Payment methods to reduce the churn rate for these services. The company should also consider offering promotions or incentives to attract more customers to its Credit Card Payment method, which has the lowest churn rate."
