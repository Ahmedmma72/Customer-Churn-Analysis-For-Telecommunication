    "#### Expectations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of predicting whether a customer will recommend the company, is closely related to Net Promoter Score (NPS),which can be extremely useful for the telecommunications company. The NPS is a widely used metric that measures customer loyalty and satisfaction, with a focus on the likelihood of customers recommending the company to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why predicting the customer recommending the company can be valuable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving customer retention: Customers who are more likely to recommend the company are also more likely to stay with the company. So this can help identify customers who are at risk of leaving, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying areas for improvement: Customers who are less likely to recommend the company may have specific pain points or areas of dissatisfaction. Answering this question can help the company identify these areas and prioritize efforts to address them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Driving growth: Customers who are more likely to recommend the company can help drive new customer acquisition and revenue growth through positive word-of-mouth referrals. Answering this question can help the company identify customers who are likely to be brand advocates and target them for additional promotions or incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of expectations, predicting the NPS can help the company gain a deeper understanding of its customers and their preferences, as well as drive improvements in customer retention, satisfaction, and revenue growth. The insights gained from answering this question can be used to inform targeted marketing and customer retention strategies, ultimately leading to increased customer loyalty and business success."
